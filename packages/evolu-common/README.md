# ðŸš§ Important Announcement: Evolu Codebase is Being Rewritten

We are currently **rewriting the entire Evolu codebase** to implement a new synchronization protocol and **remove the dependency on Effect**. This rewrite aims to make Evolu more efficient, flexible, and easier to use while enabling powerful new features.

## What This Means:
- **New Sync Protocol**: Introducing a more robust and scalable approach to synchronization.
- **No Dependency on Effect**: Simplifying the core library by removing external dependencies.
- **Breaking Changes**: No breaking changes, API is the same, and everything is backward compatible. Evolu will migrate automatically; only internal tables have been changed.

## Timeline:
The rewrite has been completed, and the new sync is almost done. Expect experimental releases before the final stable version.

Thank you for your support and patience as we make Evolu better than ever! ðŸ’¡

- [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) in all browsers, Electron, and React Native
- [CRDT](https://crdt.tech) for merging changes without conflicts
- End-to-end encrypted sync and backup
- Free Evolu sync and backup server, or you can run your own
- Typed database schema (with branded types like `NonEmptyString1000`, `PositiveInt`, etc.)
- Typed SQL via [Kysely](https://kysely.dev)
- Reactive queries with full React Suspense support
- Real-time experience via revalidation on focus and network recovery
- No signup/login, only bitcoin-like mnemonic (12 words)
- Ad-hoc migration
- Sqlite JSON support with automatic stringifying and parsing
- Support for [Kysely Relations](https://kysely.dev/docs/recipes/relations) (loading nested objects and arrays in a single SQL query)
- Local-only tables (tables with \_ prefix are not synced)
- Evolu Solid/Vue/Svelte soon

## Local-first apps

Local-first apps allow users to own their data by storing them on their devices. Modern browsers provide API designed precisely for that. How is it different from keeping files on disk? Files are not the right abstraction for apps and cannot synchronize among devices. That's why traditional apps use the client-server architecture. But using client-server architecture also means that users' ability to use an app depends on some server that can be offline, temporarily or forever, if a company decides to ban a user or even goes bankrupt. That's unfortunate. Luckily, a way to restore data ownership exists. It's Evolu.
